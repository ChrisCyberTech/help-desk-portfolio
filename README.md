# 🧰 Help Desk Portfolio

Welcome to my **Help Desk Portfolio** — a collection of real-world IT support and troubleshooting labs.

Each project simulates common **Tier 1 / Tier 2 help-desk scenarios**, focusing on Windows systems administration, networking, software diagnostics, and hardware troubleshooting.  
The portfolio demonstrates not only technical ability but also **structured documentation, problem analysis, and communication** — key skills for IT and cybersecurity roles.
