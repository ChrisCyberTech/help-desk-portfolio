# ðŸ§° Lab 5 â€“ Troubleshooting Walkthrough (Real Ticket Simulation)

This lab series simulates **real-world Tier 1 / Tier 2 Help Desk troubleshooting tickets**.  
Each sub-lab focuses on a different technical domain: **network**, **software**, and **hardware**.

These exercises demonstrate practical problem-solving, diagnostic reasoning, and technical documentation â€” all essential skills for IT Support and Help Desk professionals.

## ðŸ§­ Learning Objectives
- Apply structured troubleshooting methodology (Identify â†’ Isolate â†’ Resolve â†’ Verify).  
- Gather and analyze diagnostic evidence using OS-level tools.  
- Create reusable automation scripts for remediation.  
- Document technical findings clearly and professionally.  
- Reinforce macOS and cross-platform troubleshooting fundamentals.
